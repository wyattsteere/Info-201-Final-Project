## Major Takeaways

Our main focus questions going into this project were:

- What could be some causes for students' behavior to increase or decrease in certain areas?
- What could be the cause for people generally thinking teen behavior is getting worse?
- Should the behavior of teens continue to be monitored or studied?
- Is there a way to check that the sample is an accurate representation of all teens?

After analyzing our datasets, we were able to solve our questions and came to these conclusions:

Shifts in teenagers' behaviors could be accredited to the varying presences of drugs, alcohol, and contraceptives in certain states, or the specific region that the survey is taken from. For starters, drugs and alcohol may be more readily accessible in rural areas through under-the-table exchanges compared to in the city. Due to this, the survey results in that specific area may widely contradict the results in another part of the same state.  

Without even looking at the data, we knew that there was an underlying belief that today's teenagers are generally less-behaved than teenagers from previous generations. The main reason for this is possibly rooted in the trends that have been depicted in the popular media in recent years.

We believe that teens should still be regularly monitored because it provides health experts with benchmarks on how future generations compare to past ones acted. As seen in the data, today's teens are not as problematic compared to past generations, marking a downward shift in the data. This may change, though, as time goes on because the trends can shift upwards just as easily as they shifted downward.

To verify if the sample is an accurate representation of all teens, we would need to expand the sample size so that it accounts for more teenagers in more parts of each state. As it currently is presented, not every state participates in the survey which means that not every state's teenager is represented. Some of the notable states that aren't included are Washington, Oregon, Iowa, and Minnesota. Aside from this, not every part of the included states participate in the survey. A majority of the states only focus on the rural parts, while others primarily focus on the urban parts. An increase in sample size would need take place in order to confidently conclude that the sample is accurate representation of all teens.

## Most Important Insight

As the title of the dataset suggested, today's teens are alright. While continuing to monitor them does no harm, today's older generations should be less worried about the future of the world because our teenagers are more behaved than how they acted years ago. To give a few numbers, today's teenager compared to the average teenager born in the 1990's, is 15% less likely to have ever tried alcohol and roughly only 11% have smoked, compared to 23% back then. 43% fewer teenage girls are also having children. These figures go to show that people should not worry about regulating teenage behavior because they are already regulating it themselves.
