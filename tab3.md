# Analysis

In this chart, we take a look at the percentage of teens who have used a cigarette before over time for specific cities. The main thing noticed in these charts is that they all overlap each other nearly perfectly. This shows us that overall, the usage of cigarettes does not differ across states or cities. The most important trend to take note of is how it is increasing in recent years. The chart shows either lots of fluctuation, or a smooth decreasing trend over two-thirds of the chart, but it hits its lowest in 2013 and steadily starts to increase.
